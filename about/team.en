<h1>NetSurf's Development Team</h1>

<h2>James Bursa</h2>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 22 April 2002</li>
<li>IRC name: zamez, SVN name: bursa</li>
</ul>

<h2>John-Mark Bell</h2>

<p>John-Mark spends most of his time avoiding the layout engine, as he thinks that overexposure to it will result in the early onset of dementia. Over the years, he has contributed to a number of areas of NetSurf &ndash; particularly anything that doesn't involve touching any user interface code. He has also spent a great deal of time tracking down and fixing Richard's bugs.</p>

<p>In the past, most of his development work was undertaken on an Iyonix, using a Linux desktop running Debian for compilation purposes. Nowadays, development occurs on the Linux desktop using RPCemu for testing purposes.</p>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 25 May 2003</li>
<li>IRC name: jmb, SVN name: jmb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Michael Drake</h2>

<p>Michael contributes to several areas of the project. He is most interested in developing the layout code and has worked on other areas including text export and text selection. Before he started programming for the project, he worked on the documentation, testing and graphics. He designs promotional material such as posters and banners, as well as toolbar and interface icons. Creating and maintaining NetSurf's web site is also one of Michael's responsibilities.</p>

<p>Michael uses an Iyonix for most of his work on the NetSurf project. He also has a VirtualRPC Laptop for testing on RISCOS Ltd's brand of RISC OS and an Ubuntu machine for playing with nsgtk.</p>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 26 September 2003</li>
<li>IRC name: tlsa, SVN name: tlsa</li>
</ul>

<h2>Richard Wilson</h2>

<p>When he finds time away from his day job as an international man of mystery, Richard enjoys flailing his arms towards a keyboard and trying to make NetSurf as beautiful as the contours of a Cuban virgin's thighs.</p>

<p>He is responsible for implementing various sections of NetSurf &ndash; the ones he'll admit to include GIF, BMP and ICO support, the current frames implementation, minor sections of the CSS and layout code, the hotlist and global history, toolbars and themes, URL auto-completion, buffered rendering, interactive help, the RISC OS GUI and image rendering code, RISC&nbsp;OS image virtual memory / compression, and probably 90% of the bugs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Richard has had precious little time for development work recently, but an aged RiscPC is his partner when he does.</p>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 9 March 2004</li>
<li>IRC name: rjwii, SVN name: rjw</li>
</ul>

<h2>John Tytgat</h2>

<p>John is an occasional NetSurf contributor mostly related to cross-compile build aspects based on his knowledge and involvement in the <a href="http://gccsdk.riscos.info/">GCCSDK</a> project and <a href="http://ro-oslib.sourceforge.net">OSLib</a>. He also contributed the first Unicode related changes in NetSurf.</p>

<p>His RISC OS NetSurf builds are done using the GCCSDK cross-compiler on an Ubuntu Linux desktop machine and tested on RiscPC and A9home.</p>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 1 May 2004</li>
<li>IRC name: joty, SVN name: joty</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adrian Lees</h2>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 25 March 2005</li>
<li>IRC name: adrianl, SVN name: adrianl</li>
</ul>

<h2>Daniel Silverstone</h2>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 9 March 2006</li>
<li>IRC name: Kinnison, SVN name: dsilvers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rob Kendrick</h2>

<p>Rob contributes mainly to the GTK port of NetSurf, and helping with general portability issues between platforms.  He wrote the Cairo rendering back end which gives the GTK port anti-aliased rendering, as well as devising the new themes format.  Also some other minor contributions to the main base of the code.</p>

<p>Rob does most of his development work on his Linux desktop running Ubuntu, and also makes extensive use of an A9home for testing.  He also helps maintain the server that hosts the project's web site and mailing lists.</p>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 13 March 2006</li>
<li>IRC name: rjek, SVN name: rjek</li>

<h2>Vincent Sanders</h2>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 8 August 2007</li>
<li>IRC name: kyllikki, SVN name: vince</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fran&ccedil;ois Revol</h2>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois is a BeOS fan and Haiku developer. He started porting NetSurf to BeOS to fill the void between Links and Firefox, and to replace the closed-source NetPositive as default browser in Haiku.</p>

<p>He's always rushing to fix C89 breakages since BeOS binaries must be built using gcc 2.95 because of C++ ABI compatibility. Currently Fran&ccedil;ois builds under ZETA (BeOS R6), and tests under Haiku both on real hardware and in QEMU.</p>

<ul>
<li>First check in: 3 June 2008</li>
<li>IRC name: mmu_man, SVN name: mmu_man</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chris Young</h2>

<p>Chris is responsible for porting NetSurf to AmigaOS 4, to get an all-round decent web browser on the platform rather than having to use several outdated or incomplete ones. He refuses to deal with any of the core code beyond prodding it with a pointy stick when it doesn't quite work as expected.</p>

<p>His development work, testing and compiling is all done on an AmigaOne G4-XE.</p>
