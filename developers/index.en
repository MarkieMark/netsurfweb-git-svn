<h2>Run bleeding edge NetSurf</h2>

<p>The most important way though which NetSurf users can contribute to the NetSurf project is by regularly testing the current development builds and providing feedback.</p>

<p>RISC OS users can download a precompiled test build, which can be installed run in exactly the same way as NetSurf releases. Users of other platforms can obtain the latest source code and follow the simple compilation instructions.</p>

<p>Once running the latest build you can browse the web as normal and let us know if you run into problems. Does the browser crash? Can you reproduce the crash? Did it crash at a specific site? What was the URL? Do you like the new features of the development build? How could NetSurf's interface be improved? These and more are the sorts of questions we're interested in your answers to. Our goal is to make NetSurf a piece of software everyone loves to use, and to do that we need your input!</p>

<p>The NetSurf documentation contains guidelines for <a href="/documentation/info#FeatureRequests">making feature requests</a> and <a href="/documentation/info#Bugs">reporting bugs</a>.</p>

<h2>Porting NetSurf</h2>

<p>We are always interested to hear from people porting NetSurf to different hardware or operating systems. If you are keen to port NetSurf to a new platform please get in touch. NetSurf's developers are keen to ensure NetSurf is highly portable, so feedback is appreciated.</p>

<p>We would be especially interested in hearing from anyone who could implement the NetSurf user interface under Windows.</p>
