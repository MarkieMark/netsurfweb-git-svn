<h2 id="using">Using NetSurf</h2>

<p>To run <em>NetSurf</em>, simply double click on the NetSurf application.
This will cause the NetSurf icon to appear on the iconbar.  Select clicking
on this icon will open a browser window.  It should be noted that as NetSurf
is at a very early stage of development, much of the following information is
subject to change without warning.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/bwin.en" title="Browser Window" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="toolbar">The Toolbar</h3>

<p>The section at the top of the window is called the toolbar.  It allows quick
access to various functions and information.  The standard, or <em>Default</em>,
toolbar is shown below.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/toolb.en" title="Toolbar" alt=""></p>

<p>There are several different variations on this toolbar available, eg this
minimal one:</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/mini.en" title="Mini Toolbar" alt=""></p>

<p>In addition to this, NetSurf supports themes, which allow users to customize
the look and feel of the program.</p>

<h3>Toolbar Icons</h3>

<p>Again, it should be noted that, as NetSurf is in development, many of the
icons don't do anything yet.  In such situations, the following text describes
what the icon will do, when the associated feature has been implemented.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong>URL Bar:</strong> The white writable icon on the toolbar is called
the URL Bar and it shows the location of the current page.  Here, you can enter
the address of the page you want to view next.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong>Status Line:</strong> This text displays information to the user.
When you move the pointer over a link, this will show the URL that the link
points to.  The status line also displays information about NetSurf's progress
while retrieving a page.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong>Throbber:</strong> This NetSurf logo animates while a page is
downloading or rendering.  It indicates that NetSurf is doing something.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/back" alt="Back" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button makes NetSurf go back to the previous page in the
history list. If you followed a link from one page to another, this button
allows you to get back to the first page.  Select click to view the previous
page in the current window.  Adjust click to view it in a new window.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/mark" alt="Bookmark" class="icon"></strong>
Select clicking on this button adds the current location to the bookmarks or
favourites.  Adjust clicking opens the bookmarks window.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/forward" alt="Forward" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button allows you to advance through the history list.  Select
click to view the next page in the current window.  Adjust click to view it in a
new window.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/history" alt="History" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button opens a window containing a history tree.  Clicking on
an item in this window will move to the relevant page in the history.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/home" alt="Home" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button returns to the configured home page.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/print" alt="Print" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button will print the current page.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/reload" alt="Reload" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button will make NetSurf fetch and redraw the current page
again.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/save" alt="Save" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button will open a save dialogue box, to allow you to save the
page for future reference.</p>

<p class="iconinfo"><strong><img src="images/stop" alt="Stop" class="icon"></strong>
Clicking on this button stops whatever process that window is doing.</p>

<p>Buttons that are greyed out indicate that their function is unavailable.
This happens when you open a new browser window.  Since the window will be
displaying its first page, there would be no previous page and the back button
is grayed out.  Also, as this is the first page, the forward button is also
grayed out.</p>


<h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>

<p>NetSurf has two different menus, one is accessed by clicking menu over
NetSurf's iconbar icon and the other is opened by clicking menu over a browser
window.</p>

<h3>Iconbar Menu</h3>

<p>The iconbar menu is home to four options.  These are Info, Choices, Help and
Quit.  Info provides a little information about the application, while quit will
exit the program, closing all browser windows.  The choices option opens a
window for configuring NetSurf.  This is discussed in greater detail in the <a
href="#conf">Configuring NetSurf</a> section.  Help will launch the
documentation.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/imenu.en" title="Iconbar Menu" alt=""></p>

<h3>Browser Window Menu</h3>

<p>The browser window menu contains options relating to the content of that
window.  Many of these options are unavailable at present as this area of
NetSurf is not complete.  The following options are currently available:</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/bmenu.en" title="Browser Menu"
alt="Page, Selection, Navigate and View"></p>

<p>The <em>Page</em> submenu contains the following options relevant to the
current page:</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/bpmenu.en" title="Page Submenu"
alt="Info, Save, Full save, Export and Print"></p>

<p><strong>Page &gt; Info</strong>  This displays information about the current
page.</p>

<p><strong>Page &gt; Save</strong>  This opens a save dialogue box, allowing the
source code of the current page to be saved to disc.</p>

<p><strong>Page &gt; Full save</strong>  This opens a save dialogue box,
allowing current page to be saved to disc, including any CSS files or images etc
that the page contains.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/ssource.en" title="Save Source"
alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Page &gt; Export</strong>  This offers various export options for the
current page.  The options available are:</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/exmenu.en" title="Export Submenu"
alt="Draw and Text"></p>

<p><strong>Page &gt; Export &gt; Draw</strong>  This opens a save dialogue box,
allowing the current page to be saved as a drawfile.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/edraw.en" title="Export as Draw"
alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Page &gt; Export &gt; Text</strong>  This opens a save dialogue box,
allowing the current page to be saved as a text file.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/etext.en" title="Export as Text"
alt=""></p>

<!--

<p>The <em>Selection</em> sub menu relates to selected text in the browser
window.</p>

<p><strong>Selection &gt; Clear</strong> This deselects any highlighted text in
the browser window.</p>

-->

<p>The <em>Navigate</em> submenu contains the following options, useful for
navigating the web:</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/bnmenu.en" title="Navigate Submenu"
alt="Home page, Back one page and Forward one page"></p>

<p><strong>Navigate &gt; Home page</strong> This takes you back to the NetSurf
homepage.</p>

<p><strong>Navigate &gt; Back one page</strong> This has the same function as
the back button on the <a href="#toolbar">toolbar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Navigate &gt; Forward one page</strong> This has the same function as
the forward button on the <a href="#toolbar">toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>View</em> submenu contains the following options which affect the
rendering of the current window:</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/vimenu.en" title="Navigate Submenu"
alt="Scale view"></p>

<p><strong>View &gt; Scale View</strong> This allows you to scale the current
page affecting both text and images.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/scale.en" title="Scale View" alt=""></p>

<p>You can change the way NetSurf looks and behaves, by configuring the program.
The configuration panel is opened by clicking menu over the iconbar icon and
selecting Choices.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/conpan.en" title="Configuration
Panel" alt=""></p>

<p>The Cancel button will close the window, discarding any changes you've made.
Clicking on OK will save the new settings and close the window.  Clicking on one
of the other icons will allow you to configure that aspect of NetSurf.</p>

<h3>Browser</h3>

<p>The browser configuration window contains some general configuration options
that apply to the main browser window.  Many of these options aren't functional
at the moment as NetSurf is still in development.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/conmisc.en" title="Browser Configuration"
alt=""></p>

<h3>Proxy</h3>

<p>The proxy configuration window allows you to enable and set an HTTP proxy.
You can enter the address and port number of the proxy you want to use.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="images/proxy.en" title="Proxy Setup
Window" alt=""></p>

<h3>Theme</h3>

<p>NetSurf allows you to change the 'look and feel' of its interface.  New
themes can be downloaded from the <a
href="http://netsurf.sourceforge.net/themes/">NetSurf themes page</a> and you
can select your desired theme from this window.</p>
